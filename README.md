# Tic-tac-toe
The goal of this project was to develop a software version of the Tic-tac-toe game. This is currently a GUI-based playable version of the game, i.e., the game is played via the GUI using the mouse, with a GUI-based view of the board after each move. There is a reset feature, which resets the board if the players wish to.

## Usage
These instructions will get you a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Getting started
To get the game started, run the StartGame class as a Java Application. Or, run the Tic-tac-toe.jar file. You will be greeted with an empty grid.
